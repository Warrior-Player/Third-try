        <h1>Meow meow meow, Meow!</h1>
        <div class="circle"><br><br><br><br>Ayoo<br> check<br> my<br>foken <br>circle!!</div>
        <p>Now we move on to typography although I don't think I'll spend much here, I think I'll open the other typography file I have and then compare and see. <br>Nevermind I'm creating a new one.</p>
        <p>Moving to styling hyperlinks, we'll have to link to the other pages, then we link for some url that's not local. In <a href="page2.html" target="_blank">this page</a>, you gonna find a fine round ass made by CSS! Jk it's just a circle for now.</p>
        <p>As for <a href="page3.html" target="_blank">here</a>, there's no ass sadly, only 2 boobs! jk just 2 circles one next to each other</p>
        <p>And if you really want real boobs, you can, through <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=picture+of+a+horny+meme&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwja1LjRrbX7AhUBhxoKHQIOCbMQ2-cCegQIABAA&oq=picture+of+a+horny+meme&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzoECAAQHjoFCAAQgARQzwNYpA9ghhBoAHAAeACAAVCIAbAHkgECMTOYAQCgAQGqAQtnd3Mtd2l6LWltZ8ABAQ&sclient=img&ei=0Dt2Y9qsDoGOaoKcpJgL&bih=582&biw=1265#imgrc=naxHnyRGPU_COM" target="_blank">here</a>, directly look them up in google images.</p>

            <div class="float1">Float1</div>
            <p>Man I watched this part like twice or even more, but was not concentrating enough to 100% benefit from it. But I'm going to do so now!</p>
            <p>Life... Can't live with it, can't live without it. Actually we'll use this as a quote later somewhere.</p>
            <p>Human beings... Can't live with them, can't live without them? Naah you can do both</p>
            <p>The soul... Cannot exist with it, cannot exist without it.. xd</p>
            <div class="clear"></div>
            <p>The self...Can't neutralize with it, nor survive without it.</p>
            <p>The heart...Can't fuck around with it, can't fuck around without it.</p>
            <p>The following is a quote that I consider to be one of the best, if not the best, quotes I've ever said:</p>
            <section class="float2container">
                <div class="float2">Float2</div>
                <p>"Imagine dying while laying on your love of your life" She said. "Imagine dying while you're already dead..."He replied. He meant it. But she never understood. How could she.</p>

        <header class="columns">
            <p>Man I hate to use that lorem shit, so instead I'll try to write my own paragraphs. What to talk about though? Alright here's the thing, we're going to make the font-size big enough so that the paragraphs take space</p>
            <h2>Next Topic</h2>
            <p>Then I also want to talk about something that might bother me in future. I'm sort of chickenning out from sparring, yesterday I unconsciously wished that there will be no sparring. I don't want that man</p>
            <p>I remember in the beginning I was more or less excited to spar with people and kept wondering when will we start. But then when I had my first sparring which was not even a match, just each 2 guys hit each other, I no longer wanted it.</p>
            <p id="petersonquote">"There's this idea that Hell is a bottomless pit, and that's because no matter how hard it is, some Stupid Son of Bitch like you can make it a lot worse." <span class="nowrap">-Jordan B. Peterson</span></p>
            <p>I get you man, we're not used to being hit, because it's been a very veyr long time since I hit someone or someone hit me, but it's okay man! We're going to play it nice and smooth.</p>
            <p>Next time, I'll try to focus and either dodging alone, or dodging then counter attack, I'll try to master dodging.</p>
            <p>See, just now that I thought about it, I started feeling the stress in my heart! Man what the fuck, I got your back, why you worry so much?</p>
            <h2>Next Topic</h2>
            <p>Speaking of worrying, I have noticed today that, when I didn't think about the upcoming days, and just decided to focus on what I decided to do for today, which is 1 hour from css video, 1 hour from javascript, and 1 hour for electronics, I didn't stress at all and my heart did not bother me at all!</p>
            <p>I'm not sure why this is the case, because I already try to do this almost all the time, at least from the day Bro told me about it, do not worry about what you have to do in the future, just get what you set to be done for today DONE, and then enjoy the rest of the day. I changed the last sentence to " and then forget about the world ", and it's quite much better. So let's try not to forget this.</p>
