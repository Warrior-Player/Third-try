        <h1>Meow meow meow, Meow!</h1>
        <div class="circle"><br><br><br><br>Ayoo<br> check<br> my<br>foken <br>circle!!</div>
        <p>Now we move on to typography although I don't think I'll spend much here, I think I'll open the other typography file I have and then compare and see. <br>Nevermind I'm creating a new one.</p>
        <p>Moving to styling hyperlinks, we'll have to link to the other pages, then we link for some url that's not local. In <a href="page2.html" target="_blank">this page</a>, you gonna find a fine round ass made by CSS! Jk it's just a circle for now.</p>
        <p>As for <a href="page3.html" target="_blank">here</a>, there's no ass sadly, only 2 boobs! jk just 2 circles one next to each other</p>
        <p>And if you really want real boobs, you can, through <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=picture+of+a+horny+meme&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwja1LjRrbX7AhUBhxoKHQIOCbMQ2-cCegQIABAA&oq=picture+of+a+horny+meme&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzoECAAQHjoFCAAQgARQzwNYpA9ghhBoAHAAeACAAVCIAbAHkgECMTOYAQCgAQGqAQtnd3Mtd2l6LWltZ8ABAQ&sclient=img&ei=0Dt2Y9qsDoGOaoKcpJgL&bih=582&biw=1265#imgrc=naxHnyRGPU_COM" target="_blank">here</a>, directly look them up in google images.</p>

            <h1>Floats! Now or never, you'll float too.</h1>
            <div class="float1">Float1</div>
            <p>Man I watched this part like twice or even more, but was not concentrating enough to 100% benefit from it. But I'm going to do so now!</p>
            <p>Life... Can't live with it, can't live without it. Actually we'll use this as a quote later somewhere.</p>
            <p>Human beings... Can't live with them, can't live without them? Naah you can do both</p>
            <p>The soul... Cannot exist with it, cannot exist without it.. xd</p>
            <p>The self...Can't neutralize with it, nor survive without it.</p>
            <p>The heart...Can't fuck around with it, can't fuck around without it.</p>
            <p>"Imagine dying while laying on your love of your life" She said.</p>
            <p>"Imagine dying while you're already dead..."He replied.</p>
            <p>He meant it.</p>
            <p>But she never understood.</p>
            <p>How could she</p>
