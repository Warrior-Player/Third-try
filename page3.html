        <p>Life w dakchi, some say it's misery and sorrow; tragedy in other words <br>Some say it's a comedy even!</p>
        <p>Either way, here are some boobs to play around with! Jk just 2 circles:</p>
        <div class="circle1page3">
            <div class="nipple1page3"></div>

        <div class="circle2page3">
            <div class="nipple2page3"></div>
        </div>
        <h1>We'll complete the float training here, this time using <span class="page2span">display:flow-root</span> instead of overflow:auto</h1>
        <section class="page3p">
            <section class="page3floatcontainer">
                <div class="float1">Float1</div>
                    <p>Maybe we should consider thinking about the way we treat some people nvm XD</p>
                    <p>Life... Can't live with it, can't live without it. Actually we'll use this as a quote later somewhere.</p>
            </section>
                <p>Human beings... Can't live with them, can't live without them? Naah you can do both</p>
                <p>The soul... Cannot exist with it, cannot exist without it.. xd</p>
                <div class="clear"></div>
                <p>The self...Can't neutralize with it, nor survive without it.</p>
                <br><br>
                <div class="float2">Float2</div>
                <p>The heart...Can't fuck around with it, can't fuck around without it.</p>
                <p>The following is a quote that I consider to be one of the best, if not the best, quotes I've ever said:</p>
                
                <p>"Imagine dying while laying on your love of your life" She said. "Imagine dying while you're already dead..."He replied. He meant it. But she never understood. How could she.</p>
